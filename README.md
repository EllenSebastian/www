www directory for Quickspace PhoneGap project



This is only the www directory! You must initialize the other directories yourself by running: 
```cordova platform add android
cordova build
cordova emulate```

The config.xml file is also located in this repo, even though it should ultimately be in your project home directory. Move it to The project home directory when it is updated.
